I plan to use a python web scraping system called "scrapy" to pull information from websites specifically advertisements and third party links
I will be specifically be scraping one site and its subdirectories at a time 
Once i have a sufficient set of advertisment links i will be testing each in a VM to try and find malicious software 

any malicious software found will be inspected and sanitized then included in this project
any malicious advertisers or security faults found will not be included in this project but will be reported to the sites technical contact

I will not be accepting any bug bounties during my audit either
